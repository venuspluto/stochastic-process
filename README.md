# stochastic-process
Stochastic process represents numerical values of some system randomly changing over time. 随机过程是随机变量的总和，假设每一个粒子都是独立于其他粒子运动，其运动概率集合就是研究对象。

Project 2: This project involves markov decision process which is an important concept in game theory, information theory, genetic algorithms etc.
When a markov decision process is in state Xn=k at time n we look up the action π(k) give by the policy π and generating the new value Xn+1 using the transition possibilities. (Finding the optimal policy)
