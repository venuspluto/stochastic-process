# stochastic-process
Stochastic process represents numerical values of some system randomly changing over time. 随机过程是随机变量的总和，假设每一个粒子都是独立于其他粒子运动，其运动概率集合就是研究对象。
This project involves markov decision process which is an important concept in game theory, information theory, genetic algorithms etc.
When a markov decision process is in state Xn=k at time n we look up the action π(k) give by the policy π and generating the new value Xn+1 using the transition possibilities.
